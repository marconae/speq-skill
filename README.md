## Getting Started

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marconae/speq-skill/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Then run `claude` and type `/speq:mission` to start.

## Why I Built It

I want to leverage Claude Code as an effective tool to write software.

There are other spec-driven development tools out there; OpenSpec, BMAD, SpecKit... But I was missing the following:
1. A straightforward repeatable workflow (`plan → implement → record`)
2. A system that is not primped on one language or framework (e.g., Python or TypeScript)
3. A **permanent** and growing spec-library
4. A system that keeps the specs **small** to avoid context cluttering
5. A system that keeps **asking me instead of making assumptions**

So I built `speq-skill`. It combines Skills and Agents with a simple CLI called `speq` that adds a semantical search layer to the spec library. The search empowers the coding agent to find the right feature scenarios during planning, but also during the implementation. This avoids reading unnecessary specs into the context window.

## Who should use it?

Vibe Coding does not scale. `speq-skill` fixes this.

If you want to describe what you want and have a coding agent build the code for you, then you should give `speq-skill` a try!

 It adds a lightweight and straightforward system for spec-driven development that engineers the context for the coding agent.

## How Does it Work?

```
/speq:plan     →    /speq:implement    →    /speq:record
     │                   │                       │
     ▼                   ▼                       ▼
Creates plan.md     Implementation          Merges deltas into
with deltas         + verification          permanent specs library
```

1. **Plan** — Describe what you want. The agent searches existing specs, asks clarifying questions, and creates a plan with spec deltas.
2. **Implement** — The agent implements features using TDD. Each scenario gets a failing test first, then minimal code to pass.
3. **Record** — Review newly built feature and merge planned deltas into permanent specs. The plan archives to `_recorded/`.

Specs live in `specs/<domain>/<feature>/spec.md`. Plans stage in `specs/_plans/<plan-name>/`. The separation keeps your spec library clean while work is in progress.

## Important

`speq-skill` is a plugin for Claude Code and compatible AI coding assistants. This tool provides workflow structure and spec management only—**the AI / coding agent (such as Claude Code) generates all code, specs, or other artifacts**.

## Dependencies

This plugin uses [Serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena) and [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) MCP servers (both MIT licensed).

The `speq` CLI downloads the [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) embeddings model (~23MB) on first run for semantic search (Apache 2.0 licensed).

## License

Free and open-source under MIT. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
